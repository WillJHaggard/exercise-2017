#Scenario:
-------------------------
Please make a landing page that would help people who searched
"Bartender Certification" decide whether they need continuing education or a
new certification. An example in this space is SellerServer.com, but please
note that this not a potential business model for us, which is why we use it
as a sample for testing.

#Goal:
-------------------------
The goal of this test is to create a free-standing landing page that
can be used for PPC visitors. You will be expected to present this page so
the team can review it in a group setting.

#Measurement:
-------------------------
You will be judged on how clean and reusable the code is. Any
elements that you do not have time to create should be noted and documented
as stubs.

#Start
`yarn && yarn dev`
